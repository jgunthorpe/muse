  Usage: muse2txt [options] module1 [module2] [@songlist1] [@songlist2] ..

  Wild cards are accepted for the module names and multiple module names may
  be given.  Also a combination of Song Lists and module names can be used,
  any number of songs can be placed in the list and Song Lists may also
  contain wildcards (but not other Song Lists).  They are played from first
  on the command line to the last, in the case of wildcards they are
  appended to the list in the order that the files reside on the disk.  If a
  file is not found it is ignored.  After all the files have been added to
  the song list sort/randomize options are applied.

  Songs may be specified that exist inside zip files, this can be done in
  two ways.  The first is to give the name of the zip file on the command
  line, ie songs.zip in which case all songs contained in the zip will be
  played.  A zip path may also be used, ie songs.zip\song.s3m will play
  song.s3m from the zip.  A combination of wildcards is also possible,
  *.zip\a*.s3m is valid.  Song Lists may also contain zip paths.  -- Note,
  to use this you will have to have InfoZIP unzip (unzip.exe) in your path.
