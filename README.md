# Muse

This is a historical capture of a program I developed with some friends
in the 1990's called Muse/2.

It is a player for a series of
'[tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker)' music formats
originally written for OS/2. Tracker music was something that could be
reasonably distributed through the internet and BBS using the available
modem bandwidth of the day.

At some point I lightly ported it to some version of Linux with a basic
command line interface, however the popularity of the formats died out
with the advent of MP3 music.

As it stands in this repository, it likely uncompilable on anything that
still exists today and serves mainly as a historical look at software from
this particular period in time.
