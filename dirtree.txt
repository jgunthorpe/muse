File Key:
  *.cpp - Compilable C code
  *.h - General header
  makefile.gmk - GNU Make make file
  
Compiler Invokations
   Watcom C++ (All other targets)
      wmake -f makefile.w32         (Library Compile)
      wmake -f makefile.w32 DOS4G=  (DOS EXE Target)
      wmake -f makefile.w32 OS2=    (OS2 EXE Target, Default)
   GCC (linux)
      ./makefile.gmk (binary|clean|veryclean|depends)
      
  Interestingly enough, the only variance between targets is in the link
  phase where different libraries and targets are chosen, all the fileformats
  are target neutral.

  The header files are all copied to the dir include to adviod having to
  include every single sub-directory in the program. When make veryclean is 
  issued the copies in include are erased. The version in the source 
  directories are the latest and greatest.

Portability
  As of this writing Muse compiles in OS/2 with Watcom C++ 10.0/10.6 with
  the Warp Toolkit for certain. High C++ with som support DID at one
  time work, but I have decided to expunge all support for native DTS from
  the code, it has proved to be a bit of a hassle.
  
  Watcom C++ can also compile a Dos4G version that is linked with the file
  output routines (WAV, Raw etc). No DOS drivers for sound cards have been
  made, this would require writing a threads library for dos <ik>
  
  NT (Win32) Was considered but nothing came of it.
  
  The player was originaly constructed using Direct-To-SOM C++ (DTS) which
  gave the resulting binaries indepenadance. This was dropped due to bugs
  in HC and the general slow compile times that HC got on my 486. However,
  the MetaClass-Class mechanism that SOM uses has persisted throughout the
  code. It provides the kind of ICC I desire. Please see info.txt for
  more info on how this is done in C++.

  Also, since in some cases (OS, DOS + Win95) The sources can be built to
  mulitple targets without any code changes there are various directories
  for the output of object files and libaries in each sub dir.
