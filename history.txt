Date     Key Change
-------- --- -----------------------------------------------------------------
04-22-97 S3M Fixed a bug in S3M note trigger relating to volumes [fishhead,
             hyper3.s3m]

-- Placed 1.4.0 on http://www.ualberta.ca/~jgg/muse (Linux only)
04-08-97 FMT The rest of the formats are upgraded. The result is the loss of
             about 40k from the binary and around 4k lines of code. 
04-03-97 XM  Updated to the more modern class interface
04-02-97 S3M Updated to the more modern class interface
04-01-97 DM  Fixed ping pong loops in the new digital mixer
03-25-97 TFM Added generalized commandline parsing and some other features to
             make the Test Frame program more usefull for debugging, channel
	     soloing priting etc. It also doubles as a nice basic ui.
03-20-97 XM  Fixed a porta bug and a null instrument bug.
03-10-97 DSP Wrote the OSS-DSP driver, what a joy this was to write, Linux
             actually has a nice digital streaming mechanism.
03-01-97 ALL Dusted it off and ported the whole mess to GCC and Linux! Many
             code improvements all over the place. Alot has changed since
             1.31, those changes were released in a program called 'dactest'
	     that a few people saw. They were general all-round bug fixes to
	     the base code and a vastly improved digital mixer. Unfortunately
	     the changes resulting the trashing of the Text UI so they never
	     got packaged up for a full release. Ik. With the Linux port
	     I have taken the time to eliminate some of the sillyness that
	     stayed simply because we were moving very quickly.

-- Released 1.31
07-29-96 GUS Arrg, Watcom's optimizer screwed up the GUS timing
