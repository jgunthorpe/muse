Modules
~~~~~~~
   A Module, in this sense, is a music file format that stores both digital
   instruments and note information. Unlike MIDI files which are soly note
   information and WAV files which are a single digital instrument. Modules
   use a technique known as Wave Table Synthesis or Digital Mixing for play
   back. A more advanced, but similar system is used in most of today's
   synthesizers.

   The result is a reproduction identical to what the origial author intended
   and unlike a digitial recording the size does not grow very large for
   long songs. A 30 minute song could easialy be a mear 300k. Almost all
   of the space in a module file is used by the instruments.

   Instruments in a module are fairly simple, an attack portion which is
   used to simulate the striking of the instrument the sustain portion which
   is used to simulate the way the instrument sounds if it is continuously
   played and in some formats the decay portion which simulates the relase
   sound. On a guitar each portion could sound similar to the following:
      Attack - the fingers striking the strings
      Sustain - The free vibration of the strings
      Decay - the hand hitting the strings to stop the vibration

   The note infomation is organized into channels, each channel can play
   1 note at a time, so the more channels the more notes you can have at
   once.

   Unlike MIDI files which are played in hardware (ie with the FM chip on a
   Sound Blaster) MOD files are played in software.  The DAC (digital to
   analog converter) on your sound board is used to play digital data which is
   synthesised by the program.  Some cards, like the Gravis UltraSound (GUS),
   have a specialized chip onboard which does this same process, but in
   hardware.  Since the CPU must be used to generate the data to be played,
   time is taken away from other programs in the system. Multitasking
   allows you to do other things while the song is playing, but your system
   will seem slightly slower. This is because data is being streamed to the
   sound card at 176.5k/s (for 44kHz 16bit playback). 

   Since the synthesis method basically generates the equivilant of a WAV
   file, it has many characteristics of a WAV file, like Sampling Rate and
   bit rate. Sampling rate and bit rate combine to determine how good the
   resulting sound will be. CD's use a Sampling rate of 44KHz and a bit rate
   of 16 bits, this is considered sufficiant to reproduce a wide range of
   sound with good accuracy.

   There are many different formats for modules, a quick list:
      MOD - Original format, from the amiga which had a hardware chip to do
            the synthesis. Many different formats for mods exist, ranging
            from 4 to 32 channels
      STM - Early predecessor to S3Ms, 4 channels, but several enhancements
            on the MOD idea (Scream Tracker 2)
      MTM - A refinement on mods, 32 channels and 16 bit samples are added
      669 - Early multi channel module format, 8 channels and 9 commands.
      S3M - A format that doesn't look very much like a mod (internally) but
            works in much the same manner. Typicaly called Scream Tracker files.
            16 channels
      XM  - Fast Tracker ][ Files, unique things such as envolopes and
            an instrument/sample model are used in this format.
            32 channels
      ULT - UltraTracker, 32 channels, multiple effects, and better sample
            definition
      FAR - Farandole Composer files
            32 channels
      WOW - Very uncommon 8 channel MOD derivitive
      IT  - Impulse Tracker, this file format can have up to 256 channels,
            and uses new note action (NNA) which is very much like MIDI.
            Many of these songs require 64 channels to play.
      IT2 - A more advanced version of the IT format.

   Currently Muse/2 supports all of the above formats and a few others.

Muse
~~~~~~
   Muse/2 was the first released OS/2 S3M player, it first appeared in the
   Ethos Peripheral Evolution Demo, and had been in beta for at least 2
   months before. This was during the summer of 1995, it played it's
   first module about May 1995. After that it went on to aquire a larger
   array of formats, GUS support and many other features.
   
   Muse was also the first player to support the new IT format, it predates
   Cubic and MikIT. A released version of IT support was in July 1996!
   
   Sometime later I started using Linux and was quite disappointed with the
   quality of the modules players and decided to port Muse over. At this 
   point the name changed from Muse/2 to simply Muse.

 Installing

To be done still.

 Playing Songs

   To play a single file type 'muse asong.s3m'. Muse will autodetect
   your sound device and play the song.
   
   Right now the current UI can play a list of songs, but will not do wild
   card expansion internally, which is irrelivant for linux.

Notes about the Components
~~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~
 S3M Format
   This S3M player supports all of the normal S3M commands.  It does support
   the DMP panning command, which includes surround sound mode!

   Large S3M samples are supported.

 MOD Format
   The MOD player supports the following MOD types
      - 15 sample modules
      - ProTracker modules (4 channels)
      - NewTracker modules (4 channels)
      - FastTracker modules (6,4 channels)
      - FastTracker II modules (max 32 channels)
      - Startrekker modules (4,8 channels)
      - Atari Octalyser modules (8 channels)
      - Unknown name OCTA format (8 channels, never actually seen one)
      - unmarked 31 sample 4 channel modules
   All standard protracker commands are supported.

   Files by the extention .nst and mod.* are also recognized as MODs.

 MTM Format
   The MTM player supports all of the documented MTM effects, as well as
   large samples and 16 bit samples, although I have yet to see a MTM
   that has 16 bit samples!

 WOW Format
   Suports 8 channel WOW files, and all Protracker commands. WOW files are
   created by "Mod's Grave" (aka "Grave Composer") for the IBM.

 XM Format
   Supports Fast Tracker ][ XM files. All commands and functions are supported.

 STM Format
   Scream Tracker 2 files, .STM. All commands are supported.

 669 Format
   Composd Files, all documented commands are supported.

 IT Format
   The Latest IT2 files are now supported!

 Digital Mixer
   The Digital Mixer is capable of 8 or 16 bit output and can handle any
   bit rate. It supports surround sound encoding for modules that have a 
   command to enable it.
 
   The mixer implements a scaling algorithm to give high quality output. The
   basic idea is that louder is better. Internally Muse mixes at 32 bits of
   precision. Each channel is computed at 24 bits and is summed with all the
   other channels to give a final 32 bit waveform. This waveform is then
   crunched down to fit in 16 or 8 bits. Now, normally the crunching is done
   so that all channels can play at their loudest and the output will still
   sound correct, this is called 100% Scaling. This assumption is often
   faulty, in modern modules the higher channels are more often used to 
   simply add depth to the sound, and don't contribute to making it louder. 
   This is were the scaling comes in. Instead of scaling to 100% it is often
   a good idea to set the value higher, based on the number of channels the
   module has. Ie most 16 channel songs play well with 300%, 32 channels
   play nice with 600% and IT files generally play well with 1000% scaling.
   
   At one point Muse had an element called Dynamic Scaling Control. It 
   attempted to continually compensate for the songs current dynamic range in
   an attempt to get the highest quality output. For now this has been removed
   and the scaling factor must be manually set with the --scale option.
   
 MMPM/2 (OS/2)
   MMPM/2 based output does not support the pause command.  Since it does not
   use IBM's new DART system all of the UI commands will take a few moments to
   come into effect.  This is due to the non realtime nature of the MMPM/2
   system.  While you are waiting for a command to change the ouput you can
   still continue to use other commands. Ie hit ] many times to advance
   many songs, the line at the top will display the current song and when the
   song is finally loaded the rest of the information will be filled in and
   the audio will catch up.

   The MMPM driver will automatically determine the highest Sampling Rate/Bit
   Rate your sound card can support.

 DART (OS/2)
   This is an implementation of IBM's new Direct Audio Real Time system.  To
   use it you muse have the new DART enabled multimedia DLLS.
     AMPMXMCD.DLL
     AUDIOSH.DLL
   These dlls must be used to replace the existing mmpm dlls, see the readme
   file in that directory for more information.

   Also, it is possible to obtain the DART dlls from the Ultimate Sound
   Page, http://wvnvaxa.wvnet.edu/~hrieke/us.html.

   DART is used to enhance the stablity and speed for background playing, less
   memory and cpu are used by the DART output method than the normal MMPM/2
   method, and better skip control is also achieved.  Pause and Resume
   are implemented. The -T command line option can be used to make DART
   function in Real Time, meaning all commands take effect at once. However
   changing songs produces some noise. I recomend using DART without the -T
   option as it also makes multi tasking less jerky.

   I think it's worth mentioning, It seems to be, that EVERY dirver shipped
   with OS/2 supports dart to some degree, some of the Creative drivers have
   small problems, but in general the drivers work fine with Muse.

   -- NOTE Installing a fixpack tends to overwrite one of the two dart dlls,
   when this happens half of dart is present. Muse will give some odd error 
   and exit. You should reinstall the proper dart dlls.

 Gravis UltraSound (OS/2)
   Support has been added for the GUS in native mode through the Manely
   drivers. Version 0.85 or later is required. The GUS driver also has an IMM
   meaning you can load songs which are larger than the amount of GUS ram you
   posses. This is especially usefull with large XM files.

   Note, sometimes the GUS can lose timing, if this happens press F3 then F4.
   This will reset the timing, this is fixed in driver versions greater than
   1.10.

 WAV File Output
 AU File Output
 RAW file Output
   Used the -OWAV, -OAU, -ORAW options muse can write a song to a file, -f
   specifies the file name. the -o option is fully supported to specify the
   output type, except in .au were the output is fixed at 8012Hz, 16 bit.

   RAW is a headerless file, just the raw digital data, and the .au is in the
   SUN/NEXT U-Law encoded style.

   -- Note, entire song lists can be recorded to a file, and looping songs
   will generate infintely large files. This funtion is best used with the
   -l option (prevent loop) and single songs.

   If -f is not specified but -OWAV is the song's name will be used as a
   basis for the output name, ie k_macro.s3m.wav.

   --Note the test frame UI doesn't yet support this.
   
 OSS-DSP (Linux)
   This driver uses the OSS style /dev/dsp to output digital data to your
   sound card. It will attempt to auto detect the highest bit rate and 
   sampling rate. The command line option --oss-dsp can be used to set the
   device file to use.
